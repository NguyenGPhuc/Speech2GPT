*** Description ***
Writer assistant tool that uses AI technology to help story tellers contextualize their ideas onto paper by simply jot down anything that come to mind.
Uses OpenAI to generate random stories or mold current passge to certain theme or author style. This program also categories user passage for
easy lookup and modification. 

(WIP) Implement passage to picture using image generation AI. 

*** Purpose ***
Coming as a visual medium and graphic novel maker, I realized that I was terrible at painting a detail world using only words. I have always used pictures and video to show
characters and environment within my narative. So personal, the reason why I made this tool was to help me transform my thoughts into story.
