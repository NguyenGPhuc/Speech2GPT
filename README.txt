Help story tellers contextualize their ideas onto paper by simply tell it. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, the same passages can be crafted into a theme or style.
Coming as a visual medium and graphic novel maker, I realized that I was terrible at painting a detail world using only words. I have always used pictures and video to show
characters and environment within my narative. So personal, the reason why I created this tool was to help me transition into a more adequate writer, with practice and exmaples.
