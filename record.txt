Tell me a story in the style of H.P lovecraft about a hunter who is lost in a dream.

I was walking through a forest when I saw a clearing. It was
I thought I saw a campfire in the center of the clearing. I
went to the campfire and saw a man in a dream who said

"I am here. I am lost. I have never been lost before. I am going back to
the campfire to learn what happened."

I told him that I saw a campfire in the center of the clearing and he
replied that he didn't see a campfire in the center of the
clearing. I asked him to tell me what was happening and he
answered that he was dreaming. I told him I saw a campfire in the
center of the clearing and he replied that he didn't see
a campfire in the center of the clearing. I told him I saw a
campfire in the center of the clearing and he replied
that he was dreaming.When was bloodborne the game made?
